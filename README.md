## 🧠 Bot Strategy

The bot plays optimally using:

- **Minimax algorithm** with **alpha-beta pruning**
- **Move prioritization** (center > corners > edges)
- Position evaluation and scoring for faster decisions and smarter plays

It analyzes all possible outcomes and chooses the best move to win or block the opponent.
